# Full-Stack Web Application

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Full-Stack Web Application** developed to demonstrate complete frontend and backend integration. The application allows users to interact with the system through a user-friendly interface, while the backend processes requests, manages data, and communicates with the database securely.

The project follows a modular structure and uses modern web development practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## ⚙️ How the Project Works

1. **Frontend**

   * The frontend provides an interactive and responsive user interface.
   * Users can submit data, view information, and perform actions through forms and pages.
   * Requests are sent to the backend using HTTP/REST APIs.

2. **Backend**

   * The backend receives requests from the frontend.
   * It processes business logic and validates user inputs.
   * RESTful APIs handle communication between frontend and database.

3. **Database**

   * The database stores application data securely.
   * Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   * Ensures efficient data retrieval and storage.

4. **Authentication & Security**

   * User authentication and authorization are implemented.
   * Sensitive data is handled securely.
   * Access control ensures only authorized users can perform certain actions.
